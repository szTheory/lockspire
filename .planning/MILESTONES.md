# Milestones

## v1.1 Release Hardening (Shipped + archived: 2026-04-24)

**Phases completed:** **7** (**07-13**), **15** plans, **9** requirements (**GATE-01**-**GATE-03**, **RELS-01**-**RELS-03**, **POST-01**-**POST-03**)

**Package posture:** `lockspire 0.2.0` exists at archive time; planning milestone complete, but public product posture remains preview rather than `1.0`.

**Key accomplishments:**

- Repo-truth QA and contributor gate recovery closed the maintained `mix qa`/`mix ci` drift and backfilled formal gate verification.
- Trusted release hardening locked the checked-in publish policy, maintainer guide, protected environment proof, and approved canonical run evidence.
- Preview-support docs and contract tests now keep public claims bounded to the implemented embedded-provider wedge while leaving PAR as the next milestone candidate only.
- Final verification and ledger-reconciliation phases closed the remaining audit handoff gaps without reopening release implementation.

**Pre-close audit:** `audit-open` clear. Formal milestone audit: [`milestones/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](milestones/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md) (`tech_debt` for Nyquist completeness gaps and the `release-please-action` Node.js 20 warning only).

**Automation note:** `gsd-sdk query milestone.complete` failed again (`version required for phases archive`), so the close used manual `milestones/v1.1-*` artifacts, `ROADMAP.md` collapse, and `git rm .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

**Archives:** `milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`, `milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md`, `milestones/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` · **Git tag:** `v1.1`
